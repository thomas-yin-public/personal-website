          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Thomas. A year 3 student studying Computing at PolyU.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a cautious person who also good at logical thinking and
            problem-solving. During these 3 years of studying in the department
            of computing, I have been trained to think about things
            systematically. I can summarize the discrete information and study
            the information or requirement detailly and convert them into
            meaningful and systemic information. When facing a problem or
            dilemma, I will figure out the root of the problem first and try to
            think of different solutions to solve the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also good at coding and programming. When programming a
            solution, each line of code must be precise and concise. Missing a
            character can lead to the corruption of the whole program.
            Therefore, it makes me cautious when handling different problems
            even in daily life.
